# Active Context: Blockchain Market Cap Application

## Current Work Focus
The project has moved from planning to active development. We've established the basic structure of the application and implemented several key components. Our current focus is on completing the cryptocurrency listing functionality, implementing proper error handling, and ensuring consistent styling across the application.

## Recent Changes
- Created the basic project structure with Blazor and Vue.js integration
- Implemented Home and About pages with proper styling
- Set up the SCSS structure with variables, base styles, and component styles
- Created the API service for fetching cryptocurrency data
- Implemented the CryptoCurrency model
- Added MainLayout component with responsive design
- Created the NotFound page for error handling

## Next Steps
1. **Fix Error Handling**:
   - Fix the Routes.razor file to properly handle error routes
   - Implement proper error handling for API requests
   - Add loading states for the cryptocurrency table

2. **Complete Cryptocurrency Listing**:
   - Finish the cryptocurrency table implementation
   - Add sorting functionality with proper visual indicators
   - Implement pagination or infinite scrolling
   - Add refresh mechanism for data updates

3. **UI Improvements**:
   - Ensure consistent styling across all components
   - Add visual feedback for loading and error states
   - Implement accessibility improvements
   - Optimize responsive design for all device sizes

4. **Testing and Optimization**:
   - Set up unit testing framework
   - Create tests for API service layer
   - Optimize data fetching and rendering performance
   - Implement caching for API responses

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### API Implementation
- Using CoinGecko API for cryptocurrency data
- Need to implement caching to handle API rate limits
- Should add fallback mechanisms for API failures
- Consider adding offline support for basic functionality

### UI/UX Improvements
- Need to ensure consistent button and link styling
- Add visual feedback for loading and error states
- Consider adding animations for improved user experience
- Ensure color contrast meets accessibility standards

### Performance Optimization
- Implement efficient client-side sorting
- Consider lazy loading for large data sets
- Optimize bundle size for faster initial load
- Use pagination or virtual scrolling for large data sets

### Error Handling Strategy
- Create consistent error handling pattern across the application
- Implement user-friendly error messages
- Add logging for API failures
- Consider retry mechanisms for transient errors

### Responsive Design
- Test design on various device sizes
- Optimize table display for mobile devices
- Ensure touch-friendly UI elements on mobile
- Verify font sizes and spacing on different screens
