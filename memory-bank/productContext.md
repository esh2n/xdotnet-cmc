# Product Context: Blockchain Market Cap Application

## Why This Project Exists
This application addresses the need for a simple, straightforward way to monitor the market capitalization of major blockchain currencies. While many complex cryptocurrency tracking platforms exist, this project focuses on providing just the essential information without overwhelming users with excessive features or data.

## Problems It Solves
- **Information Overload**: Many existing crypto tracking platforms contain too much information and complex features, creating a steep learning curve
- **Accessibility**: Simplifies access to current cryptocurrency market data for casual observers or newcomers to blockchain
- **Focus**: Eliminates distractions by focusing solely on market capitalization as a key metric

## How It Should Work
1. The application loads with a clean interface displaying a table of major cryptocurrencies
2. Data is automatically fetched from cryptocurrency APIs upon page load
3. Users can sort the table by clicking on column headers to reorder data
4. The interface remains responsive across desktop and mobile devices
5. The page design follows a minimalist approach, making the data the primary focus

## User Experience Goals
- **Clarity**: Information should be presented in a clean, unambiguous format
- **Speed**: Page should load quickly and sorting operations should be instantaneous
- **Simplicity**: The interface should be intuitive with no learning curve
- **Freshness**: Data should be current and show when it was last updated
- **Accessibility**: Design should accommodate users of all abilities, following web accessibility standards
