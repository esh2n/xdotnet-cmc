# Project Brief: Blockchain Market Cap Application

## Overview
A web application that displays the current market capitalization of major blockchain currencies. The application fetches real-time data from cryptocurrency APIs and presents it in a clean, user-friendly interface with basic sorting capabilities.

## Core Requirements

### Data Retrieval
- Fetch market cap data for major cryptocurrencies (BTC, ETH, and other significant currencies)
- Obtain data through direct API calls from the web application
- Update data at regular intervals to maintain currency

### User Interface
- Display cryptocurrency data in a tabular format
- Implement simple sorting functionality (by market cap, price, etc.)
- Create a responsive design that works across devices

### Technical Requirements
- Utilize ASP.NET Core Blazor for the server-side rendering and core functionality
- Implement client-side interactivity with Vue.js
- Style the application using SCSS
- Build and bundle the application using Gulp and webpack

## Project Scope
- This is a read-only application (no user authentication or data saving)
- No dedicated infrastructure beyond hosting the web application
- Focus on simplicity and performance
- No requirement for historical data or trend analysis
